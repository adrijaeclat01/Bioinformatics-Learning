# Bioinformatics & Computational Learning Repository

This repository contains my practice files as I learn R, Python, data analysis, and core bioinformatics concepts.  
I will use this space to build strong foundations in both experimental biology interpretation and computational methods.

## 🔬 Biology + Data Analysis Focus
- Proteomics data analysis  
- Transcriptomics basics (counts, normalization, DE analysis)  
- Volcano plots and differential expression  
- PCA, clustering, heatmaps and visualization  
- Interpretation of SDS-PAGE, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and other experimental patterns

## 💻 Coding & Programming Skills
- Learning R for data manipulation and statistical analysis  
- Learning Python for automation, visualization, and ML workflows  
- Working with CSV, TSV, and XLSX file formats  
- Building clean and reproducible code scripts

## 🤖 Machine Learning (ML) Learning Path
- Understanding ML basics (classification, regression, clustering)  
- Using Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)  
- Trying ML on biological datasets (gene expression, protein data)  
- Learning how ML aids biomarker discovery and disease prediction  

## ☁️ Cloud Computing Skills
- Understanding what cloud computing is  
- Using Google Colab for running Python notebooks  
- Exploring cloud-based data processing  
- Future goal: learn basics of AWS / Azure for bioinformatics tasks  

## 🧬 Computational Biology & Bioinformatics
- Learning workflows in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics  
- Understanding pipelines and data standards  
- Integrating ML + biology for meaningful insights  
- Building a structured, computational thinking mindset  
- Keeping the core biological logic central while using computational tools

This repository will evolve as I learn R, Python, ML, cloud computing, and computational biology,  
and begin integrating these skills with my core training in molecular biology, immunology, and cancer biology.
